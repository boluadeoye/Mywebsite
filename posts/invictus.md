"Invictus," by William Ernest Henley, is a triumphant declaration of the human spirit's resilience. Written while Henley was in the hospital facing the amputation of his leg, it has become an anthem for anyone facing adversity. Its power lies in its unwavering assertion of self-mastery and courage against all odds.

> Out of the night that covers me,
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black as the pit from pole to pole,
> I thank whatever gods may be
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my unconquerable soul.
> 
> In the fell clutch of circumstance
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not winced nor cried aloud.
> Under the bludgeonings of chance
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My head is bloody, but unbowed.
> 
> Beyond this place of wrath and tears
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looms but the Horror of the shade,
> And yet the menace of the years
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finds and shall find me unafraid.
> 
> It matters not how strait the gate,
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How charged with punishments the scroll,
> I am the master of my fate,
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am the captain of my soul.
