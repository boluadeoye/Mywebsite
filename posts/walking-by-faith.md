# Walking by Faith

## The Path Unseen

Three months before graduation, and everyone keeps asking, "What's next?" I smile, give vague answers about "exploring opportunities," but the truth is—I don't know. And I'm learning that's okay.

Faith isn't the absence of questions; it's the presence of trust despite them.

## The Abraham Complex

We often talk about Abraham leaving Ur without knowing his destination. But we forget he was seventy-five years old when he started that journey. He had lived, loved, built a life—then God called him to uncertainty.

At twenty-three, I feel I should have everything figured out. But maybe faith means admitting I don't, and walking anyway.

## The Nigerian Reality

In Nigeria, we're raised with clear expectations:
- Graduate by 22
- Get a job immediately
- Marriage by 25
- Build a house in the village

But what happens when God's timeline doesn't match society's schedule?

## My Testimony

Last year, I applied for an internship I desperately wanted. I prayed, fasted, claimed it. I didn't get it. I was devastated, questioned God, wondered if He heard me at all.

Three months later, that company shut down. All interns were left stranded, unpaid.

Meanwhile, a small opportunity I had overlooked blossomed into something beautiful—a writing fellowship that changed my perspective on my calling.

God's no often carries a better yes.

## The Cloud Principle

The Israelites followed a cloud by day and fire by night. When the cloud moved, they moved. When it stayed, they stayed. Sometimes for days, sometimes for months.

They couldn't rush the cloud. They couldn't GPS their route to the Promised Land. They had to trust daily guidance.

## Walking Lessons

Here's what I'm learning about faith-walking:

**1. Faith has a rhythm**  
Sometimes we run, sometimes we walk, sometimes we wait. All are movement when directed by God.

**2. Faith requires community**  
When I can't see the way, I lean on others who've walked this path before.

**3. Faith doesn't eliminate fear**  
It just means fear doesn't get the final say.

**4. Faith is practical**  
It's applying for jobs while trusting God's provision. It's studying hard while believing in divine wisdom.

## The Morning After

Every morning, I wake up to the same uncertainty. But I also wake up to the same God who has been faithful through:
- Secondary school struggles
- JAMB preparations
- University challenges
- Family storms
- Personal battles

If He was faithful then, why would He stop now?

## Declaration

So I declare: I will walk by faith, not by sight. I will trust the Author even when I can't see the end of the chapter. I will believe that the God who started this good work will complete it.

Not because I'm strong, but because He is faithful.  
Not because I can see, but because He can.  
Not because the path is clear, but because the Guide is trustworthy.
