There is a holy work happening in the dark—the kind that looks like nothing but becomes everything.

> “The seed sprouts and grows; he does not know how.” — Mark 4:27

## What the Silence Is Doing
- Deepening roots before height.
- Strengthening faith before sight.
- Forming patience before fruit.

A seed buried in soil is not forgotten; it is positioned. In the quiet, God is not delaying—He is developing.

## Three Anchors While You Wait
1. Promise precedes evidence. Hold the promise.
2. Process protects the promise. Don’t rush it.
3. Prayer keeps the soil soft. Stay surrendered.

> “Those who sow in tears shall reap with shouts of joy.” — Psalm 126:5

## Prayer
Father, teach us to trust Your timing. When we cannot see the growth, let us trust Your hand beneath the soil. Make us faithful sowers and patient waiters. Amen.
