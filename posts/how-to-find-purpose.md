In our hyper-connected world, the question "What is my purpose?" can feel overwhelming. We are flooded with the curated highlight reels of others' lives, endless streams of information, and a constant pressure to do more, be more, and achieve more. The noise of the world can easily drown out the quiet, steady voice of God trying to guide us.

Finding our purpose isn't about adding another item to our to-do list. More often than not, it's about subtraction. It’s about intentionally creating quiet spaces where we can begin to hear that guiding voice again. If you feel lost in the noise, here are three simple practices to help you find your God-given purpose.

### 1. Practice Intentional Subtraction
Your purpose is likely not buried under a mountain of new activities, but hidden beneath a pile of existing distractions. You cannot hear a whisper in a shouting match. To find your purpose, you must first lower the volume of the world. This could mean implementing a "digital sunset" (no screens an hour before bed), taking a Sabbath day completely free from work and social media, or even just scheduling 20 minutes of silent, uninterrupted time each day to simply sit and be. By removing the clutter, you create the margin necessary to notice what truly matters.

### 2. Listen to Your "Holy Discontent"
What breaks your heart? What problem in the world, your community, or your family makes you think, "Someone really ought to do something about that"? That feeling of holy discontent is often a direct, personal call from God. He plants a specific burden on our hearts because He has equipped us to be part of the solution. Your purpose is often hidden in the answer to the question: "What problem can I not stop thinking about?" Don't ignore that righteous frustration—pray into it. It may be the very signpost you've been looking for.

### 3. Focus on the Next Faithful Step
We often imagine our "purpose" as a single, grand, lifelong destination. This can be paralyzing. We feel that if we don't have the next 20 years mapped out, we have no purpose at all. But faith doesn't work that way. More often, purpose is revealed one step at a time. Instead of asking, "What is my ultimate purpose in life?" ask a simpler question: "God, what is the next faithful thing you want me to do?" It could be encouraging a friend, serving at your church, starting a small group, or learning a new skill. Purpose isn't a destination we arrive at; it's the path we walk by taking the next faithful step, again and again.

**Let's pray:**
Father, quiet the noise of the world around me and the anxiety within me. Help me to hear Your voice. Show me the problems you have designed me to solve, and give me the courage to take the next faithful step in the direction you are leading. Amen.
