Let's be honest. We love a good ending.

We celebrate the final page, the finished painting, the moment the plane touches down. We post pictures of the diploma, not the all-night study sessions. We're conditioned to look for the highlight reel, the grand finale.

But what if the most important part of the story isn't the end? What if it's the messy, uncertain, and beautiful space in the middle?

I'm talking about the quiet, drawn-out moments between a heartfelt prayer and its answer. The chaotic, coffee-fueled stretch in a project when the initial excitement has worn off, and the finish line is nowhere in sight. It’s that long, lonely hallway you walk down after one door has slammed shut, waiting for another to creak open. Many people describe this as a time **when you feel stuck**.

We call it "waiting" or "struggling." But what if it's actually the key to **finding purpose in waiting**? This is the "in-between"—what some call **the messy middle**—and while we’re often desperate to escape it, it’s the very place where the real work of life happens.

#### You're Not Buried, You're Planted

Think of a seed. To become anything, it must first be buried in darkness. It’s pressed and crushed by the weight of the earth. From the outside, it looks like an ending. It looks like nothing is happening.

This is the in-between of faith. It’s that season of **trusting God's timing** when you can't see the promise. We think our faith is forged in dramatic storms, but I think it's truly tempered in the quiet, agonizing patience of the soil. It's the stubborn belief that even when you feel buried, you're actually just being planted.

#### The Ache of Becoming

Life isn't a straight line; it's a series of transformations. The person you were before a great joy or a deep sorrow is not the person you are today. The "in-between" is the ache of becoming.

It's that profoundly uncomfortable feeling of being no longer what you were, but not yet what you will be. It's easy to mistake this for being lost. But it’s not. You're in a chrysalis. You’re shedding the skin of your former self to make room for a stronger, more resilient you. This process isn't pretty, but it is absolutely necessary for your growth.

#### Trusting the Process When the Muse is Gone

Every creative person knows the feeling. The brilliant idea that woke you up at 3 a.m. now feels like a tangled mess on the page. The inspiration is gone, and only the hard work remains.

This is the in-between of creativity. It’s where your discipline has to be stronger than your mood. It’s where you learn that showing up, even when you feel empty, is the most powerful thing you can do. This struggle doesn't mean your work is failing; it’s a sign you’re learning how to truly trust the process. You’re building the grit not just to start things, but to see them through.

So, if you feel like you're in the middle of something today—in the waiting, the wondering, the wrestling—I want to encourage you. You are not in a void. You are in the workshop. You are in the rich soil where roots grow deep. **Finding purpose in waiting** isn't about ignoring the struggle; it's about seeing the value in it. This isn't just a pause in your story. This *is* your story. And it's the very chapter where your future is being beautifully, and powerfully, forged.
