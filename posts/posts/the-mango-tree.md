# The Mango Tree

Every childhood has a tree. Mine was the old mango tree in my grandmother's compound in Ikere-Ekiti. Its branches spread wide like protective arms, offering shade from the afternoon sun and stories from generations past.

## The Gathering Place

Under this tree, Grandma would sit on her worn wooden stool, cracking palm kernels while telling us stories of the tortoise and his clever ways. "Ijapa o," she would begin, and we would chorus back, "Ijapa Tiroko!"

The tree had seen my mother's childhood, witnessed her wedding ceremony, and now watched over us—the third generation. Its trunk bore carved initials of lovers, dates of important events, and scratch marks from climbing adventures gone wrong.

## Lessons in Patience

"You see this tree?" Grandma once asked during mango season. "It doesn't fruit because you command it. It fruits in its time, when the season is right."

I was eight then, impatient for everything—for the mangoes to ripen, for secondary school, for life to begin. But the tree taught me differently.

> "To everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under heaven."

## The Storm

One August, a terrible storm came. We watched from the window as the wind bent the old tree, its branches thrashing wildly. By morning, several branches had broken off, and the tree looked wounded, defeated.

But Grandma only smiled. "Watch," she said.

## New Growth

By the next rainy season, new shoots had appeared where the branches broke. The tree grew differently now—not taller, but stronger, its remaining branches thicker and more fruitful than before.

"This is resilience," Grandma explained. "Not avoiding the storm, but growing through it."

## The Last Summer

The last summer before university, I spent every evening under that tree, reading for JAMB, dreaming of the future. The tree had become my thinking spot, my refuge, my connection to home.

As I packed for FUOYE, Grandma handed me a small jar. Inside were dried mango seeds from our tree. "Plant them wherever you go," she said. "Let your roots travel with you."

## Epilogue

Today, in my small corner of the campus, a young mango tree grows. It's barely two feet tall, but when I water it each morning, I hear Grandma's voice in the rustling of its leaves:

*"Child, you carry your heritage within you. Bloom where you are planted, but never forget the soil that nourished your roots."*

---

*For all the grandmothers who plant trees whose shade they'll never sit under, but whose children will gather beneath for generations to come.*
