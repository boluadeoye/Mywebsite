​How tiny steps build big momentum
​You know that feeling when you've got a great idea, but it feels so big and overwhelming that you just... freeze? I know it all too well. It's a classic case of what I like to call "perfect plan paralysis." We tell ourselves we'll start once everything is perfect, but the truth is, a perfect plan is just a fantasy.
​What if we let go of that pressure and just started small? A tiny, almost insignificant step today. Another tiny step tomorrow. The real magic isn't in a flawless plan; it's in the simple act of showing up, day after day. It's about building a rhythm, a habit, and a little bit of momentum.
​Consistency beats perfection every single time. It's the reason a slow, steady stream carves a canyon, while a flash flood just rushes by. This is a space to explore that journey, to celebrate the small victories, and to remind ourselves that every great thing starts with a single, imperfect step.
​This is a writing space for a beautiful beginning.
