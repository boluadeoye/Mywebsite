# Morning Dew

The earth awakens with whispered prayers,  
As morning dew kisses the grass.  
Each drop, a blessing suspended in time,  
Reflecting the first light of dawn.

The cock crows thrice from the neighbor's compound,  
Announcing hope's arrival once more.  
While the acacia tree stretches its arms,  
Welcoming another chance to grow.

> "Joy comes in the morning" - Psalm 30:5

I watch the sun paint the sky orange,  
Like my mother's wrapper on Sunday mornings.  
The air carries the scent of wet earth,  
And promise of rain yet to come.

This is how grace appearsâ€”  
Not in thunder or lightning,  
But in gentle drops of morning dew,  
Reminding us that we too can begin again.
