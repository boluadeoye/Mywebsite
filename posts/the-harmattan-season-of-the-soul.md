The Harmattan arrived not with a roar, but with a whisper of dust, mirroring the dry season that had settled in Mama Adesuwa’s soul. Her prayers felt like words launched into the vast, hazy sky, and her once-vibrant faith seemed coated in the same reddish film as the leaves in her garden. This, she knew, was her Harmattan of the spirit.

“Mama, why don’t you just pray for the rain to come?” her grandson, Emeka, asked one afternoon.

She leaned on her broom, her gaze drifting to a hardy acacia tree near the fence. “The rain will come when it is meant to, my child. Until then, we learn what the waiting is for.” She pointed with her chin. “Look at that tree. The dry season forces its roots to grow deeper, to search for water far beneath the surface. This season gives it a strength the gentle rains never could.”

Weeks passed. Her prayers began to change. She no longer asked for the season to end, but for the faith to endure it—for deeper roots.

Then, one evening, a cool breeze cut through the haze, damp and fragrant with the promise of relief. By the next morning, the sky was a blanket of deep grey, and the first fat drops of rain began to fall, tapping a gentle rhythm on the iron roofs.

Mama Adesuwa stepped out onto her veranda, letting the cool water wash over her face. The scent of wet earth filled the air, a fragrance of renewal. She understood then. The dryness had not been an absence of God, but a season of preparation. It was the season that had taught her soul to grow roots.
