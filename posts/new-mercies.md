**Scripture**: Lamentations 3:22–23

Thomas Chisholm wrote the hymn “Great Is Thy Faithfulness” while living with fragile health and modest means. No fame, no perfect circumstances—just quiet trust, one day at a time. His life reminds me that mercy doesn’t wait for everything to be neat; it arrives with the morning light.

So I’m starting today without yesterday’s weight. God’s love hasn’t run dry. My task is simple: receive grace and take the next faithful step.

**Prayer**: Lord, thank You for undeserved, daily mercy. Teach me to begin again today.

**Quote to carry**: “Great is Thy faithfulness.” — Thomas Chisholm
