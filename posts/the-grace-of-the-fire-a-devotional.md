In 1967, a single dive into shallow water changed everything for 17-year-old Joni Eareckson Tada. Vibrant and athletic one moment, she was paralyzed from the shoulders down the next. Her world was plunged into a fire of pain, confusion, and desperate questions for God.

We often pray for God to quench the fires in our lives. We ask Him to deliver us *from* our trials. But Joni’s story shows us that sometimes, God’s greatest grace is found *in* the fire. It was from her wheelchair that her true life’s work began. In her helplessness, she found a deeper dependence on God. Her suffering carved out a space in her heart for a new kind of compassion, giving birth to a global ministry that has touched millions.

This morning, perhaps you feel the heat of your own fire—a disappointment, a loss, a struggle that feels overwhelming. It’s natural to want to escape. But what if God is present, not just in the rescue, but in the refining? What if the very thing you feel is breaking you is what He is using to open up a new purpose within you?

May we have the courage today to not just ask God to end the fire, but to meet us within it. For it is there, in the heat, that His grace can forge something new, beautiful, and unexpectedly strong. Amen.
