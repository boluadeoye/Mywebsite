“His mercies are new every morning.” — Lamentations 3:22–23

There are days the to-do lists feel taller than we are. Days we realize yesterday’s strength won’t carry into today. That’s not failure — it’s design. God invites us to receive fresh grace for each day’s assignment.

### What grace looks like
- Strength to start again, even if yesterday was messy.
- Quiet courage to do small things with great faithfulness.
- Gentleness with yourself while God grows you steadily.

> Pray: “Lord, I don’t need tomorrow’s power yet — give me grace for today.”

When you reach for grace in the morning, you won’t run on fumes by evening. He supplies. You walk.
