In the quiet before dawn breaks,  
When the world holds its breath,  
I find You in the spaces between heartbeats,  
In the pause before words take shape.

## I.
Sometimes the loudest prayers  
Are whispered in silence,  
When words fail to carry  
The weight of our longing.

## II.
The chapel at FUOYE stands empty  
This early morning hour,  
But it thrums with the echoes  
Of yesterday's hallelujahs.

Can walls remember worship?  
Can floors recall kneeling?  
I think they do—  
I think silence holds sound  
The way soil holds seeds.

## III.
My grandmother taught me  
That God speaks Yoruba,  
But I've learned He's fluent  
In sighs too deep for words.

> "The Spirit helps us in our weakness... with groanings which cannot be uttered." - Romans 8:26

## IV.
There's a holiness in hushed moments:  
The breath before the test results,  
The pause before "I love you,"  
The silence after lightning,  
Counting seconds until thunder.

## V.
Tonight, I sit with my Bible closed,  
Not reading but listening,  
To the echo of ancient promises  
Reverberating in present silence.

*Selah*—that mysterious word  
Scattered through Psalms,  
Perhaps means this:  
Stop. Listen. Let the silence speak.

## VI.
And in this quiet space,  
Between what was and what will be,  
Between the question and answer,  
Between the wound and healing,

I hear it—  
Not a voice like thunder,  
Not a whisper in the wind,  
But an echo of Love so deep  
It needs no sound to be heard.

---

*For those who pray without words,  
Who worship in waiting,  
Who find God in the gaps—  
Your silence is sacred too.*
