I have always had a complicated relationship with the Harmattan. As a child, I loved the cool, dry air that was a welcome relief from the humid heat. But as I grew older, I began to resent the haze. The world, once sharp and vibrant, would become muted, shrouded in a fine, reddish dust. The sun was a pale orange disk in the sky, and the horizon simply disappeared.

One year, the haze felt particularly heavy, mirroring a season of confusion in my own life. I felt stuck, unable to see the path forward. My prayers felt like they were being absorbed by the dusty air, never reaching the heavens.

Frustrated, I sat in the yard with my grandmother as she patiently cleaned beans, tossing them in a wide, flat basket. The air was thick with the smell of dust and dry leaves.

"I can't stand this haze," I complained. "I feel like I can't see anything clearly. I just want it to be over so I can know which way to go."

My grandmother paused her work. She looked up, not at the pale sun, but at the small, sturdy mango tree in our yard. Its leaves were coated in a film of dust, but it stood firm.

> The Harmattan does not hide the world. It just forces you to look at what is right in front of you.

She gestured with her chin towards the mango tree. "You cannot see the mountains today. But you can see this tree. You can see the patterns the dust makes on its leaves. You can feel the coolness of the shade it gives. This season teaches us to find our footing in the things we can touch, not just the things we hope to see in the distance."

She looked back at me, her eyes clear and wise. "Your path is still there, my child, even if you cannot see the end of it. Be patient. Tend to the things that are right in front of you. When the dust finally settles, and it always does, you will not only see the way forward, but you will also be stronger, and you will appreciate the clear view so much more."

In that moment, her simple words settled the dust in my own heart. I learned that the dry, hazy seasons of life are not empty. They are an invitation to focus on the small, immediate acts of faith, to be patient, and to trust that clarity will return in its own time.

**Let's pray:**
Father, in my seasons of confusion and uncertainty, help me to be patient. Teach me to find purpose in the present moment and to trust that you are with me, even when the path ahead is hazy. Let me find strength in this season of waiting. Amen.
