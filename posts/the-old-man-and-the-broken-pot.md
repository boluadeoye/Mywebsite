There once was an old man in a small village who had the daily task of fetching water from a distant river. He carried two large clay pots, each hanging on one end of a pole he balanced across his shoulders.

One of the pots was perfect, and it always delivered a full portion of water after the long walk. The other pot, however, had a long crack running down its side. By the time the old man arrived back at his house, the cracked pot would have leaked half of its water along the path.

For two years, this went on daily. The perfect pot was proud of its accomplishments, flawless in its service. But the poor cracked pot was deeply ashamed of its own imperfection, miserable that it could only do half of what it had been made to do.

Finally, after two years of what it perceived as bitter failure, the cracked pot spoke to the old man one day by the river. "I am so ashamed of myself," it cried. "Because of this crack in my side, water leaks out all the way back to your house. You do all of this work, but because of my flaw, you only get half the reward."

The old man smiled kindly. "As we return to the house," he said gently, "I want you to notice the beautiful flowers growing along the path."

Indeed, as they went up the hill, the cracked pot noticed the sun warming the beautiful wild flowers on its side of the path, and it was cheered for a moment. But at the end of the trail, it still felt the sting of its failure, as it had once again leaked out half its load. It began to apologize again.

The old man simply said:

> "Did you not notice that there were flowers only on your side of the path, and not on the other pot's side? That is because I have always known about your flaw. I took advantage of it. I planted flower seeds on your side of the path, and every day while we walk back from the river, you have watered them. For two years, I have been able to pick these beautiful flowers to decorate my home. Without you being just the way you are, there would not be this beauty to grace the house."

Each of us has our own unique flaws. We are all cracked pots in some way. But it is the cracks and flaws we each have that make our lives together so very interesting and rewarding. We must take each person for what they are and look for the good in them, for in God's great economy, nothing is wasted.
