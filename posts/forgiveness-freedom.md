Unforgiveness is a prison. We often think that by withholding forgiveness, we are keeping the person who hurt us locked up. We believe our anger and resentment are the bars that hold them accountable. But if we look closer, we realize we are on the same side of the bars as they are. We have built a cell of bitterness, and we have locked ourselves inside it.

We rehearse the hurt, replaying the scene over and over in our minds. We feed our anger, tending to it like a fire. We do all of this believing we are punishing our offender, but the only person who feels the heat of that fire, the only person trapped in that cell, is us. The person who hurt us is likely living their life, completely unaware of the prison we've built for ourselves.

Jesus's call to forgive is not a call to be a doormat. It is not a call to pretend that what happened was okay. It is a radical call to freedom. It is the key to our own prison door.

> Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you. (Colossians 3:13)

When we forgive, we are not saying, "You are free from the consequences of your actions." We are saying, "I am freeing myself from the burden of carrying your offense." We are taking the key, turning the lock, and walking out of the cell. We are leaving the other person and the debt they owe in God's hands, trusting Him to be the perfect judge, so that we can be free to live in peace.

The choice to forgive is one of the hardest we can make, but it is also one of the most powerful. It is the moment we stop allowing a past hurt to control our present and dictate our future. It is the moment we choose freedom.

**Let's pray:**
Father, I confess that I have been living in a prison of unforgiveness. It is exhausting. Today, I choose to use the key You have given me. I choose to forgive. Release me from this bitterness and resentment, and help me to walk in the freedom and peace that can only be found in You. Amen.
