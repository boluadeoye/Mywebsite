I remember once giving a total stranger directions with absolute, unshakeable confidence. I pointed them down a series of roads, smiled, and wished them well, feeling proud of my helpfulness. It was only ten minutes later, as I was walking home, that a cold dread washed over me. I had mixed up two streets. I had sent them in the completely wrong direction. For the rest of the day, I couldn't shake the feeling of foolishness and shame over such a small, clumsy mistake. I wished I could find them again, apologize, and get a do-over.

We’ve all had moments like that, and often, they are far more serious than giving bad directions. We say the wrong thing, make a poor decision, or hurt someone we love. In those moments, the weight of our failure can feel crushing, as if we have permanently ruined the clay. We feel disqualified, believing we’ve used up our last chance.

But the beautiful, core truth of our faith is that God's economy is not like ours. His supply of grace is never-ending. It doesn't run out. It doesn't expire.

> The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases; his mercies never come to an end; they are new every morning; great is your faithfulness. (Lamentations 3:22-23)

Read those words again: "new every morning." God’s grace is not a limited resource that we have to ration. It is a fresh, clean slate delivered to us with the rising of the sun, every single day. Yesterday's failures, no matter how great, do not have the power to cancel today's mercy.

Unlike us, God doesn't see a ruined vase. He sees clay, rich with potential, that He can lovingly reshape. He is the Master Potter. A second chance—or a hundredth chance—is not about grudgingly fixing a mistake. It is about joyfully remaking us, again and again, into something even more beautiful.

Whatever mistake is weighing on your heart today, know this: you have not used up your chances. His love is steadfast, and His mercy for you is brand new, right now, in this very moment.

**Let's pray:**
Father, thank you for the incredible gift of a fresh start. Help me to release the shame of yesterday and to fully accept the new mercy you offer me today. Teach me to not only receive this grace but to extend it to others just as freely. Amen.
