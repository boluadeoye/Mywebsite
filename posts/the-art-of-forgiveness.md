Of all the commands we are given in scripture, few are as difficult and as misunderstood as the call to forgive. We often see forgiveness as an act of justice, something to be granted only when the other person has earned it, apologized for their actions, or acknowledged their wrongdoing. To forgive before then feels like saying, "What you did was okay." It feels like letting them win.

But this is a fundamental misunderstanding of what forgiveness truly is.

Forgiveness is not about the other person. It is not about absolving them or minimizing the pain they caused. The pain is real, and the wrong was real. Forgiveness is a profound act of self-love and spiritual liberation. It is for *you*.

Holding onto unforgiveness, bitterness, and resentment is like carrying a heavy backpack filled with sharp rocks. The person who hurt you does not feel its weight; only you do. It drains your energy, poisons your joy, and keeps you tethered to the very moment that caused you pain. It is like drinking a cup of poison and waiting for the other person to get sick.

The act of forgiveness is the moment you decide to set that heavy backpack down. It is the moment you choose to stop drinking the poison. You are not saying the offense was acceptable; you are saying you will no longer allow that offense to have power over your heart. You are handing the burden of justice over to God, who is the only one equipped to carry it, and choosing to walk forward in freedom.

> Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you. (Ephesians 4:32)

Forgiveness is rarely a single event; it is a daily process. It is a choice we must sometimes make over and over again, leaning on God's strength each time. It is the difficult, beautiful, and necessary art of releasing an unseen weight and allowing God's healing to finally begin.

**Let's pray:**
Father, you know the hurt I carry. It is too heavy for me. I choose today to hand it over to you. Give me the supernatural strength to forgive those who have wronged me, not for their sake, but for mine. Release me from the prison of bitterness and allow me to walk in the freedom of your grace. Amen.
