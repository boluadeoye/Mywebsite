The sun had baked the earth of Alafia village into a mosaic of cracks. The stream, once a source of life and laughter, was now a dusty scar on the landscape. The elders had prayed, sacrificed, and watched the cloudless sky with weary eyes, but the drought held its grip.

It was in this season of thirst that the village began to notice Adekunle. A young man of few words, he was seen walking the long path to the distant, nearly dry river, carrying a large, empty, woven basket on his shoulder.

Laughter and scorn followed him like his shadow. "Does he think he can catch the wind?" one woman jeered. "Adekunle has been touched by the sun," another muttered.

The village elders, their brows furrowed with concern, summoned him to the shade of the great Iroko tree. "Adekunle," the chief said, his voice heavy with authority. "This is foolishness. You cannot carry water in a basket. You bring shame to your family and mock our suffering."

Adekunle met their gazes with a calm that unnerved them. His reply was soft, yet it carried the weight of conviction.

> The one who sent me knows the nature of the vessel.

He bowed his head and continued his journey, leaving the elders speechless.

He returned at sunset, just as the sky bled into hues of orange and purple. A crowd had gathered, eager to witness his failure. But as he approached, a collective gasp rippled through the onlookers. The basket on his shoulder was full, shimmering with water that glowed with a soft, internal light. A few glowing drops escaped the weave, yet the basket remained full.

He walked past the stunned crowd to the village's dry well and tipped the basket. A stream of pure, clean water poured in. He did this not once, but three times, the water in his basket never seeming to diminish.

The chief, humbled, approached him. "How is this possible?"

Adekunle looked at the woven basket, then at his own hands. "You were all focused on the weakness of the vessel," he said, his voice finally clear and strong. "You forgot to consider the power of the Source."
