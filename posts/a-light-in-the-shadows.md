In a truly dark room, it does not take a blazing sun to make a difference. A single, small flame from a match or a candle is enough to push back the oppressive darkness, to reveal the shape of the room, and to show you the next step on the path. The flame does not eliminate all the shadows, but it provides a focal point of warmth and hope.

There are seasons in our lives that feel like that dark room. We are surrounded by the shadows of grief, uncertainty, fear, or loneliness. In these moments, we often pray for the sun to break through in a spectacular, instantaneous miracle. But sometimes, God's answer comes not as a sunrise, but as a single, steady flame.

That small light might be a verse of scripture that suddenly speaks to your heart with new meaning. It might be an unexpected phone call from a friend who simply says, "I was thinking of you." It could be a moment of unexplainable peace during prayer, or a flicker of strength you didn't know you had.

These are not small things. They are everything. They are the lanterns God places on our path, not always illuminating the entire journey, but giving us just enough light to take the next faithful step. Our task in the shadows is to learn to notice, cherish, and walk by the light of these small flames, trusting they are enough.

The Bible gives us this powerful promise:

> The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it. (John 1:5)

The darkness can be vast, but it is never victorious. A single flicker of divine light holds more power than an entire ocean of shadow.

**Prayer:** *Lord, when I am surrounded by shadows, help me to see the light You provide, no matter how small it may seem. Grant me the faith to take the next step, guided by the gentle flame of Your presence and Your promises. Amen.*
