We live in a world that is obsessed with the pursuit of happiness. We chase it in our careers, in our relationships, and in our possessions. We scroll through social media feeds filled with smiling faces and exotic holidays, believing that happiness is a destination we can arrive at if we just try hard enough. We treat it like a prize to be won. And sometimes, we do win it. A promotion, a new car, a perfect evening with friends—these moments bring a genuine, wonderful feeling of happiness.

But then, the feeling fades. The car gets a scratch, the evening ends, a difficult day follows a good one. If our spiritual life is built only on the foundation of happiness, it becomes a fragile and exhausting rollercoaster of emotions. This is because happiness is almost always tied to our *happenings*. But the Bible speaks of something deeper, something more resilient. It speaks of joy.

Happiness is external; it is a reaction to our circumstances. Joy, however, is internal; it is a fruit of the Spirit. It is a deep-seated state of being that can exist even in the midst of sorrow and hardship. It is not an emotion that comes and goes with the weather, but a spiritual anchor that holds us fast. As the scripture says:

> ...the joy of the Lord is your strength. (Nehemiah 8:10)

It does not say the "happiness of the Lord" is your strength. Happiness is a wonderful gift, but it is too fragile to be our source of strength. Joy is the conviction that, no matter what is happening around us, God is with us and His promises are true.

Think of it this way: Happiness is like a kite, soaring high on a beautiful, windy day. It is a glorious sight, but its flight is entirely dependent on the weather. When the wind stops, the kite falls. Joy, on the other hand, is like a deep-rooted tree. A storm can lash its branches and strip its leaves, but the tree remains standing, drawing strength from a source deep underground, unseen by the world.

Let us be grateful for the moments of happiness God gives us—they are blessings to be cherished. But let us not build our house on that shifting sand. Instead, let's focus on cultivating joy by deepening our roots in Him through prayer, worship, and time in His word. For it is this joy that will be our strength, holding us steady long after the winds have died down.
