Life, like the sea, is not always calm. There are seasons of gentle waves and sunny skies, but there are also seasons of storms—when the winds of uncertainty howl, the waves of grief crash over us, and we feel hopelessly tossed about. In these moments, it's easy to believe that our faith has failed us. We cry out, "God, where are you?"

We often mistakenly believe that a strong faith will prevent storms from ever reaching us. We imagine that if we pray enough or believe hard enough, our path will be smooth. But scripture never promises us a storm-free life. What it does promise is an unshakeable anchor in the midst of the storm.

> We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure. (Hebrews 6:19)

An anchor does not stop the storm. It does not calm the waves or silence the wind. An anchor's only job is to hold the ship fast to something solid and unmovable, preventing it from being swept away by the chaos.

This is the nature of true faith. Faith is not a magic shield that repels hardship; it is the anchor that connects our soul to the unmovable rock of Jesus Christ. The storm may rage around us, and we may feel the violent rocking of the boat, but our anchor holds.

The strength of your faith is not measured by the calmness of your sea, but by the object of your trust. Are you trusting in your own ability to navigate the waves? Or are you trusting in the anchor that holds you to the ocean floor?

When the storms of life hit, the goal is not to pretend you are not afraid or that the boat is not rocking. The goal is to check your anchor. Remind your soul that it is tied to something—to Someone—infinitely stronger than any storm. Your feelings of fear may be real, but the security of your anchor is even more real.

**Let's pray:**
Lord, I am in a storm, and I am afraid. Help me to take my eyes off the waves and to fix them on you, my unshakeable Anchor. Remind me that you are holding me fast, even when I feel like I'm being swept away. Let my hope be firm and secure in you alone. Amen.
