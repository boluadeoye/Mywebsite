<h2>The Unbreakable Rule</h2>
<p>At the heart of every clear English sentence lies an unbreakable rule: the subject and the verb must agree. This means a singular subject needs a singular verb, and a plural subject needs a plural verb. While it sounds simple, an entire ecosystem of grammatical traps can obscure the true subject of a sentence, leading to common errors that undermine a writer's authority.</p>
<p>Mastering this rule isn't just about being "correct"â€”it's about creating prose that is clear, professional, and effortless for the reader to understand.</p>

<h2>The Core Principle: Singular with Singular, Plural with Plural</h2>
<p>In most cases, singular verbs in the present tense end with an "-s," while plural verbs do not. This is often the reverse of how we form plural nouns, which can be a source of confusion.</p>

    end
</div>
<blockquote><strong>Singular:</strong> The <strong>writer</strong> <strong>thinks</strong>.</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Plural:</strong> The <strong>writers</strong> <strong>think</strong>.</blockquote>

<h2>Common Pitfall #1: The Prepositional Phrase Decoy</h2>
<p>The most common mistake is confusing the subject with a noun in a prepositional phrase (a phrase beginning with words like 'of', 'in', 'between', 'on'). The verb must agree with the true subject of the sentence, not a noun hiding in a descriptive phrase.</p>
<blockquote><strong>Incorrect:</strong> A <strong>box</strong> of apples <strong>are</strong> on the table.</blockquote>
<p>Here, the subject is "box" (singular), not "apples." The phrase "of apples" is just describing the box. Therefore, the verb must be singular.</p>
<blockquote><strong>Correct:</strong> A <strong>box</strong> of apples <strong>is</strong> on the table.</blockquote>

<h2>Common Pitfall #2: Collective Nouns</h2>
<p>Collective nouns (like 'team', 'committee', 'family', 'audience') can be tricky because they can be either singular or plural depending on the context.</p>
<h3>Acting as a Single Unit (Singular)</h3>
<p>If the group is acting as a single, cohesive unit, treat the noun as singular.</p>
<blockquote>The <strong>team</strong> <strong>is</strong> heading to the finals. (The team as one entity)</blockquote>
<h3>Acting as Individuals (Plural)</h3>
<p>If the members of the group are acting as individuals, treat the noun as plural.</p>
<blockquote>The <strong>committee</strong> <strong>are</strong> arguing over the budget details. (The members are arguing with each other)</blockquote>

<h2>Advanced Case: Indefinite Pronouns</h2>
<p>Indefinite pronouns are words that don't refer to a specific person or thing. Some are always singular, some are always plural, and some can be either.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Always Singular:</strong> each, either, neither, one, everyone, everybody, anyone, anybody, no one, nobody, someone, somebody.</li>
    <li><strong>Always Plural:</strong> both, few, many, several.</li>
    <li><strong>Can be Either:</strong> all, any, more, most, none, some (depends on the noun they refer to).</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><strong>Correct:</strong> <strong>Each</strong> of the writers <strong>has</strong> a unique style. (Each is singular)</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Correct:</strong> <strong>Some</strong> of the <strong>cake</strong> <strong>is</strong> gone. (Refers to a singular noun, "cake")</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Correct:</strong> <strong>Some</strong> of the <strong>cookies</strong> <strong>are</strong> gone. (Refers to a plural noun, "cookies")</blockquote>
